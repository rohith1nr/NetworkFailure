# Machine Learning Project: Network Data Analysis

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using a synthetic network dataset. The goal is to preprocess the data, train various machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn


## Dataset

The notebook uses a dataset named synthetic_network_data.csv. Ensure this file is present in the same directory as the notebook.

## Execution Steps

1. *Clone or Download the Repository*:
   Download the project folder containing the notebook and dataset.

2. *Open the Notebook*:
   Open the final_code.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook:

   bash
   jupyter notebook final_code.ipynb
   

3. *Run the Notebook Cells*:
   Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially:

   - *Library Imports*: The first cell imports necessary libraries like pandas and numpy.
   - *Data Loading*: The dataset is loaded using:
     python
     df = pd.read_csv('synthetic_network_data.csv')
     
   - *Exploratory Data Analysis*: Preview the dataset using commands like df.head() and check for null values.
   - *Data Preprocessing*: Includes encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
   - *Model Training*: Train multiple machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
   - *Evaluation*: Evaluate the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

4. *Modify or Extend*:
   Feel free to add additional models, tweak hyperparameters, or include visualizations for better insights.

## Outputs

- The notebook will display:
  - Exploratory analysis insights
  - Preprocessing summaries
  - Model performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

- *Missing Dataset*: Ensure synthetic_network_data.csv is in the same directory as the notebook.
- *Library Errors*: Verify all required libraries are installed using pip.
- *Code Errors*: Ensure you are running the cells in sequence without skipping.

## Additional Notes

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with machine learning workflows. It is an excellent starting point for further experimentation with algorithms and data preprocessingÂ techniques.
